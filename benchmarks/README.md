# Benchmarks (TODO)
The term benchmarks really means documented comparisons in this case.
This folder aims to show comparisons in openMTPK's Machine Learning
related methods againsts Scikit-learn's pre-built modules, as well as
speed/effeciency on diverse datasets. Other methods of effeciency and
speef will be tests in other creative ways.
