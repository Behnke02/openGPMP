Process: Function creates a queue,

/*
Name: buildAdjacencyList
Process:  Prompts user for total vertices, the total number of neighbors each vertex has,
          all the neighbors, and builds adjacency list for each vertex. Before neighbors are placed,
          the constant NO_NEIGHBOR is placed in each element of the neighbor arrays.
          The visited array is initialized. All relavent information is placed in vertexStruct.
          The vertexStruct variable that has all relavent information is returned.
          
          Note about vertexAdjacencyList array:
          Adjacency vertex lists are stored in a 2D array (vertexAdjacencyLists[firstDimension][secondDimension]).
          The second dimension is an array of all the neighbors a given vertex has. The first dimension is the vertex
          that has those neighbors.
          
          ex: vertexAdjacencyLists[1][0]; // this accesses vertex 1's first neighbor

Function output/parameters: none
Function output/returned: created vertex struct (GraphType)

Dependencies: clearAdjacencyLists, printf, scanf, malloc, sizeof, initializeVisitedArray

HINT: When a function requires a pointer parameter, and the only information avaliable is not a pointer,
passing in the address of that variable will satisfy the parameter requirements.

    ex: &vertexStruct
