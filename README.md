# Overview 
RM-pkg is a <ins>**R**</ins>eusable <ins>**M**</ins>athematics library written in C++ with a primary
focus on Numbery Theory and Cryptographic algorithms, Linear Algebra, and Machine/Deep learning concepts
as well as a range of language API's for integration with pre-existing projects.
RM-pkg is originally inspired from uundergraduate coursework and work done on [vpaSTRM](https://github.com/akielaries/vpaSTRM). 
The project welcomes contributors and is in need of mathematics focused/interested programmers
comfortable in C and C++. If interested see 
[here](https://github.com/akielaries/RM-pkg/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

The goal is to make a reusable mathematics library similar to the use of math.h allowing users to call 
within their own projects. Some of the implementations seen in the package were first prototypes in 
Wolfram Mathetmatica, then translated to C++ code for the package.
Look in the [drivers](https://github.com/akielaries/RM-pkg/tree/main/drivers) folder for examples 
on using these tools in your own project. 

## API Bindings
The goal of this project is to also develop as laterally as possible, so as I develop the modules
for RM-pkg, the programming language bindings will come along with it. Perhaps other languages will
be explored.

# Examples
All examples are in the [drivers](https://github.com/akielaries/RM-pkg/tree/main/drivers) folder
```
# clone the repo and enter
$ git clone git@github.com:akielaries/RM-pkg.git 
$ cd RM-pkg

# to run all examples 
$ ./all.sh

# to remove the generated binaries
$ make clean-mods

# run unit tests and other checking methods
$ make run-tests

# clean up generated test files
$ make clean-tests
```

Example C++ driver file for running Caesar Cipher & Mono-Alphabetic Substitution
Keyword cipher:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <RM-pkg/number_theory/cipher.hpp>

int main() {
    // declare CIPHER class obj
    Cipher cc;
    
    /* CAESAR CIPHER */
    std::string text0 = "Plaintext";
    int shift_key_0 = 5;
    std::string hashtext_0 = cc.C_cipher(text0, shift_key_0);
    std::cout << "Hashtext0 = " << hashtext_0 << std::endl;
    
    /* TESTING MONOALPHABETIC SUBSTITUION KEYWORD CIPHER */
    std::string shift_key_2 = "Computer";
    std::string text2 = "Password";
    // encode the plaintext
    std::string encoded_text = cc.KC_encode(shift_key_2);
    // call the cipher function
    std::string hashtext_2 = cc.KC_cipher(text2 , encoded_text);
    
    std::cout << "Hashtext2 = " << hashtext_2 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
A Python example showing the same functionalities.
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3.10
from RM_pkg import Cipher

c = Cipher()
cipertext_0 = c.C_cipher('Plaintext', 5)
print(ciphertext_0)

ciphertext_1 = c.C_cipher('ATTACKATONCE', 4)
print(ciphertext_1)

text = "Password"
shift = "Computer"
encoded_text = c.KC_encode(shift);
hashtext = c.KC_cipher(text, encoded_text);
print(hashtext)
```

# Installation
For now there is not much use of this package unless you wanted to include the 
definition + implementation files in your own project with a little modification.
The use of Makefiles + shell scripts to compile modules, tests, clean generated files,
and more for development purposes. When the package reaches a *publishable state*, I 
will create an installation process with CMake compiling the source files into a clean
object for your standard directories with callable headers in `usr/include`. Since I 
use Linux as my main development environment, installation instructions will make the 
assumption you are using the same. Builds/tests for OSX will also be in development in
later stages.
## Dependencies
The use of `libxbgi` graphics library is seen in some modules of this project for
visualization of different mathematical algorithms such as Mandelbrot Fractal Sets.
To install this library simply run the dependencies.sh shell script
```
./dependencies.sh
```
